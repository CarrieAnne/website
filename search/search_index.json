The first GACS concept scheme, GACS Core, was created between 2014 and 2016 by a joint working group of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, CAB International (CABI), and the National Agricultural Library of the USDA (NAL) and substantially improved and revised by Lori Finch with a quality control project in 2017. Work on GACS Core was substantially facilitated by the Global Open Data for Agriculture and Nutrition (GODAN). The GACS namespace is currently owned by CABI, which coordinates the GACS Working Group along with the French Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA). GACS Core is a concept scheme with circa 15,000 concepts selected from, and mapped to, the most frequently used concepts of three larger concept schemes: AGROVOC (FAO), CAB Thesauris (CABI), and NAL Thesaurus (NAL). The editorial policies for GACS follow best practices of modern thesaurus design as reflected in ISO 25964, \"Thesauri and interoperability with other vocabularies\", and is expressed in Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), with some extensions, for publication as Linked Data.
