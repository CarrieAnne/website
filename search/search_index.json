Alternative labels are optional; hidden labels, though part of SKOS, are not used.","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"definitions/","text":"In GACS: Definitions are provided, where needed, to help users understand the meaning of a concept and decide on its use. There is no requirement that a concept have a definition. A definition must be consistent with the position of a concept in the hierarchy of concepts. A definition differs from a scope note, which focuses on what differentiates the concept in question from other concepts. A concept may have one or more definitions, and each definition may be expressed in one or more languages. Additional definitions need only be corrected or removed if they are in conflict with each other or with the hierarchy. (In GACS 4.0, many concepts have two or three definitions inherited from AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT.) A definition consists of a narrative explanation -- the actual definition -- plus a mandatory indication of source. Editors of GACS are encouraged to paraphrase from available sources in writing definitions, taking care not to re-use exact wordings unless the words in question are in the public domain. Where a definition has been written by a GACS editor, the most salient source of inspiration for the definition should be cited, where applicable, or by default the source cited should be \"GACS Editors\". A definition may be quoted from a source in the public domain. Only in rare cases, at the discretion of a GACS editor, should a definition be quoted from a copyrighted source. A definition should be stated as clearly and objectively as possible without erroneously limiting the concept to a specific discipline. For definitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, the original indication of source in AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, are retained in GACS. Definitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT that lack such an indication of source will be assigned a default source of \"AGROVOC Editors\", \"NALT Editors\", or \"CABT Editors\". [For discussion: URIs could be minted for teams of editors.] In cases where a GACS concept has inherited more than one definition, those definitions should be kept as long as they do not repeat or conflict. The source of a definition should not be cited in-line, in the manner of a journal article, but recorded in a separate source field. The source of a definition may be indicated in the form of a literal citation. Such citations should supply enough information to identify the version or edition of a source without ambiguity. The source of a definition may be indicated in the form of a URI which, in the judgement of the GACS editor, is likely to remain stable over time. A URI should not, for example, point to a Web search box or rely on the resolution of an embedded database query.","title":"Concept definitions"},{"location":"docproperties/","text":"ISO 25964 defines a scope note as a \"note that defines or clarifies the semantic boundiaries of a concept as it is used in the structured vocabulary. ...

It was suggested that these inherited note be dropped from GACS because their \"use other term\" references typically refer only to terms in AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT, whereas they should refer to other terms in GACS.

As a SKOS concept scheme, GACS identifies its concepts with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for use in Linked Data. GACS Beta 3.1, published in May 2016 with 15,000 concepts and 350,000 terms (labels) in over 25 languages, will soon be superseded by GACS core , the result of a recent GACS Quality Improvement Project . Created since 2014 on the initiative of three organizations, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI), and the USDA National Agricultural Library (NAL), GACS was formed at the intersection of most-frequently-used concepts from their three respective thesauri -- the AGROVOC Concept Scheme , CAB Thesaurus , and the NAL Thesaurus , for which GACS provides a mapping hub.

It aims at providing enough explanation and historical context to convey the rationale for the design principles underlying GACS. It is intended to serve as a living document that will be amended as GACS evolves. GACS is expressed as a SKOS concept scheme, so readers will benefit from a basic understanding of Simple Knowledge Organization Scheme (SKOS) .","title":"Guidelines"},{"location":"labels/","text":"In GACS, concepts are labeled with natural-language phrases. Concept labels, or \"terms\", are preferred or alternative. Preferred terms can be used as tags for subject indexing (as \"descriptors\"). The precision of term-based indexing depends on the uniqueness of the strings used to encode the terms. In production environments, for example when thesauri are used in complex workflows, it is important that preferred terms also remain stable. Terms other than preferred terms are non-preferred, or alternative (\"non-descriptors\"). Because non-descriptors are used to direct users to preferred terms, they are also known as \"lead-in-terminology\". In standard thesaurus practice, non-descriptors are not used to tag resources for indexing and retrieval. In accordance with thesaurus practice, SKOS prescribes that concepts not have two preferred labels in a given language and recommends that preferred labels in a given language be unique within the context of a given concept scheme (e.g., that no two concepts share the prefLabel \"lime\"@en). In accordance with the SKOS specification, it is an error if a concept has a same literal both as its preferred label and as an alternative label. In GACS: Preferred labels MUST be unique for the core languages of GACS. That is, one concept MUST NOT have the same preferred label as another concept in the same (core) language. Note: \"unique\" is case insensitive. Preferred labels SHOULD be unique for the other (non-core) languages of GACS. That is, one concept SHOULD NOT have the same preferred label as another concept in the same (non-core) language. In core languages, an alternate label MUST NOT be identical to a preferred label of another concept. In other (non-core) languages, an alternate label SHOULD NOT be identical to a preferred label of another concept. Alternate labels MUST be unique for the core languages of GACS. That is, one concept MUST NOT have the same alternate label as another concept in the same (core) language. Alternate labels SHOULD be unique for the other (non-core) languages of GACS. That is, one concept SHOULD NOT have the same alternate label as another concept in the same (non-core) language.","title":"Concept labels"},{"location":"names/","text":"Concepts of type \"organism\" are 29% of GACS Beta 1.6. Of these, over 83% have a scientific name as prefLabel. The remaining 17% includes: common names : goats, lizards, ducks, shrimps, honey bees, mangolds. names of organism groups : young animals, plant parasitic nematodes, aquatic insects, small ruminants, farmed fish, macroinvertebrates, racing animals, rodents, pets, cash crops. names of special kinds of organism : stallions, kids, weanlings, bitches, beef bulls, yearlings, ewes, ducklings, germ-free animals, herds, fish larvae. The scientific names of organisms are markedly \"translinguistic\" -- i.e., they are often used unchanged across a broad range of world languages. Scientific names may be expressed as \"Latinate\" (Latin or Latin-like) phrases, such as \"Tsuga canadensis\" or \"Picea engelmannii\". Exceptions include viruses, which are translingually named in English, e.g., \"Foot-and-mouth disease virus\". If the goal of GACS were to provide a definitive database for species or taxons, it might follow relevant standards such as Darwin Core, which designates scientific names with a special property. In order to meet the simpler use cases of bibliographic indexing, GACS follows the thesaurus paradigm of concepts with preferred and alternate labels. Insofar as scientific names are translingual, they are considered in GACS as belonging to no language in particular. Labels with scientific names are tagged with a code, 'zxx', defined in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 for content that is not specific to any language (@cite). In GACS, the distinction between preferred and alternative labels is largely orthogonal to the distinction between scientific and common names. A scientific name may be the preferred label (e.g., \"Leptinotarsa decemlineata\") and the corresponding common name the alternative (\"Colorado potato beetle\"). Vice versa, the common name may be preferred (\"dogs\") and the scientific name alternative (\"Canis lupus familiaris\"). For example: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | Condition | prefLabel | altLabel | |------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------| | 1:1 Common to Species Name | __Species__ | __Common__ | | | Leptinotarsa decemlineata | Colorado potato beetle | | | Camelus bactrianus | Bactrian camel | | | Quercus rubra | Northern red oak | | 1:N Common to Species Name | __Species__ | __Common__ | | | Campanula | Bluebells | | | Barleria | | | | Mertensia | | | | Eustoma | | | | Hyacinthoides | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Lori Finch prepared a note about common names and Latin names in GACS .","title":"Scientific and common names"},{"location":"reference/","text":"GACS reference documents [1] T.

The concept alfalfa , for example, is defined by relations such as: alfalfa hasType Product alfalfa BT legumes alfalfa RT fodder plants fodder plants RT livestock feeding fodder plants RT forage fodder plants RT hay These relations are reflected in the GACS definition of alfalfa as: \"A valuable leguminous crop for forage or hay used in livestock feeding \". However, less than 20% of the concepts in GACS have definitions, and crafting definitions for the other 80% would be expensive, especially across translations in multiple languages. Moreover, narrative definitions are less useful than semantic relations for automated processing because relations between concepts can only roughly be computed from label strings, sentence parsing, and the co-occurrence of words. Explicit semantic relations provide a basis for browsing broader, narrower, or related concepts and for expanding queries. They can be used to disambiguate meanings and to check concept hierarchies for consistency. Because they cluster related examples, they are less vulnerable than definitions to misinterpretation by translators. In GACS, definitions are \"nice to have\", but semantic relations are essential. For maintainability, the set of semantic relations used in GACS has been kept as simple and obvious as possible. Broader, narrower, and related concepts GACS concepts are linked among themselves with related , broader , and narrower relations as defined in SKOS, which are themselves based on standard thesaurus relations ( RT , BT , and NT ). Broader and narrower do not formally distinguish between \"is a\" and \"part of\" relations. In GACS, broader and narrower are generally intended to imply general-to-specific \"is a\" relations, though not in a formally strict ontological sense, and there are plenty of exceptions (for example, Maryland , which is \"part of\" the North Eastern States (USA) ). Top-level concepts All concepts in GACS are grouped under three concepts that have no broader concepts (top-level concepts): Objects : material things that can be seen, touched, visited (locations), including conceptual objects such as ideas and models. Events and actions : things that happen, such as processes or phenomena. Properties : attributes, characteristics, or qualities of things. In thesaurus practice, top concepts are typically intended for use in faceted browsing or in creating microthesauri. In GACS, the top concepts can be used as entry points for browsing GACS by thematic group in the Hierarchy tab of the Skosmos browser. The top concepts are too abstract to be used for indexing. Concepts further down in the hierarchy are more concrete and more useful both for indexing and for clarifying meanings (disambiguation). While a certain amount of polyhierarchy (where concepts have more than one broader concept) may be inevitable, even desirable, it seems unrealistic to expect that a complex polyhierarchy could be enforced and maintained in a principled way and at scale. For GACS, the goal is to to keep the hierarchy simple, and as close to the ideal of cascading \"is a\" relations, as pragmatically possible. Concept types Differentiating between types of concept can help clarify the meaning of concepts across the hierarchy. While top concepts, with their hierarchies, might in principle be used to group concepts by the type of thing they represent, such as \"organisms\", the GACS hierarchy does not follow the principle of general-to-specific (hyponymy) strictly enough to ensure that \"is a\" (\"type of\") relations always hold; the hierarchy also contains \"part of\" (meronym) relations. The GACS Working Group opted to explore the usefulness of concept types by creating types of SKOS concept for just four particularly obvious and clearly defined types of things: Chemical , Geographical , Organism , and Product , with Topic as a fifth \"catch-all\" type for all concepts not otherwise covered (and with the expectation that Topic might be further differentiated over time). Custom (non-SKOS) relations between concepts Some thesauri, such as AGROVOC and CAB Thesaurus, use semantic relations beyond standard SKOS properties to express more specific relations between concepts. However, efforts to \"ontologize\" thesauri with such additional relations struggle to ensure that the properties would be applied consistently, comprehensively, and maintainably. The GACS Working Group decided that custom relations should only be created for use cases important enough to justify the effort. Two properties qualified: hasProduct and productOf , for relating fish as a product to fish as an organism . Mapping to concepts in external vocabularies GACS was created at the intersection of three existing thesauri, and each concept in GACS has a SKOS \"exact match\" relation back to the concept or concepts in AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT from which it was created. In addition, the 540 concepts of type Geographical have SKOS \"close match\" relations to entities in Wikidata. These mappings facilitate access from GACS to Wikidata information about geographic places (such as coordinates, population, language, and religions); to Wikidata mappings out to other geo-oriented vocabularies such as GeoNames and OpenStreetMap; and to mappings out to library-oriented authority files such as the Library of Congress Name Authority File, GND (German union authority), BNF, VIAF and ISNI. As an example, see the Wikidata entry for Alberta ) and the corresponding GACS concept . This exercise suggests a model by which GACS might, in the future, devolve or delegate responsibility for specific types of GACS concepts to external authorities. Geographic places are an obvious candidate for delegation because they are not specific to agriculture and because they have been given URIs in so many other sources. Once mapped to a external source, a given set of GACS concepts could be reduced to a set of URIs clearly marked as dependent on the external URIs, and the GACS community could promote the use of the external URIs. GACS concepts cannot simply be deleted because their URIs must be credibly persistent, in accordance with explicit policies, if GACS itself is to be credibly deployable. On the other hand, the GACS URIs also provide a fallback option should the external authority ever cease operation, a contingency that would be prudent to anticipate by policy.","title":"Concept relations"},{"location":"relations/#defining-concepts-with-semantic-relations","text":"A GACS concept is formally defined by its \"semantic neighborhood\", a web of associative and hierarchical relations with other concepts in GACS.
