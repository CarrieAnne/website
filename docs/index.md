### Semantics for the Interoperability of Agricultural Data

Modern agriculture needs data on a wide range of topics, from crop yields to
soil composition and rainfall, in a wide range of digital formats, from
spreadsheets to maps.  How well such diverse data sources can be integrated to
solve specific problems in agriculture depends in part on whether they are
based on compatible concepts ("semantic interoperability").  The practicalities
of semantic interoperability in agricultural data have been addressed in:

* [RDA Agrisemantics Working
  Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/agrisemantics-wg.html) of the
  Research Data Alliance.  
* [Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS)](https://agrisemantics.org/GACS/).
* [GODAN Action VEST / AgroPortal map of standards](http://vest.agrisemantics.org)
